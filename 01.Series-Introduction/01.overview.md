# Overview of the Advanced JavaScript Series

## Prerequisite Concepts
Before diving into this series, it's essential to have a solid understanding of the following concepts:
- Basic JavaScript syntax and structure
- Understanding of variables, data types, and operators
- Familiarity with functions and scope
- Knowledge of arrays and objects
- Basic understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM)
- Basic understanding of Callbacks , promises and Async/await.
- Basic understanding of Fetch and handling data through APIs


## Tip:
Try reading the first overview file in each folder to understand the folder Structure and files. All the folders are formatted in same order mentioned in their **01.--overview.md**


To reach the top 1-5% in JavaScript, This series is focused on the following key areas:

## 1. Series Introduction.
- series overview 

## 2. Deep Understanding of JavaScript Execution Context
- **Execution Context & Call Stack**
  - How JavaScript code is executed
  - Global Execution Context (GEC) vs. Function Execution Context
  - Memory Allocation & Garbage Collection
- **Scope & Closures**
  - Lexical Scope & Scope Chain
  - `var`, `let`, `const` & Temporal Dead Zone
  - Closures & Practical Uses (e.g., memoization, data encapsulation)
  - Hoisting & TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)
    - How `var`, `let`, `const`, and function declarations are hoisted
    - Avoiding common hoisting pitfalls

## 3. Advanced Asynchronous JavaScript
- **Event Loop, Microtasks & Macrotasks**
  - How the Event Loop works
  - Microtasks (e.g., `Promise.then`, `MutationObserver`) vs. Macrotasks (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `MessageChannel`)
  - Starvation problem & optimizations
- **Promises & Async/Await (Deep Dive)**
  - Chaining vs. Nested Promises
  - Error handling strategies (e.g., `catch`, `finally`)
  - Parallel vs. Sequential Execution (e.g., `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, `Promise.allSettled`)
- **Web Workers & Multithreading in JavaScript**
  - How Web Workers work
  - Offloading heavy computations

## 4. Object-Oriented JavaScript & Prototypes
- **Prototype Chain & Inheritance**
  - `__proto__` vs. `prototype`
  - `Object.create()`, `Object.setPrototypeOf()`
  - How prototypal inheritance works under the hood
- **Classes & the 'new' Keyword**
  - How `new` works internally
  - Class-based vs. Prototype-based inheritance
  - Static vs. Instance Methods

## 5. Functional Programming in JavaScript
- **Higher-Order Functions**
  - Functions as first-class citizens
  - Currying & Partial Application
- **Pure Functions & Immutability**
  - Why immutability matters
  - Deep vs. Shallow Copy (e.g., `structuredClone`, `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify)`, `lodash.cloneDeep`)
- **Composition & Point-Free Style**
  - Avoiding unnecessary variables
  - Function composition using `compose` and `pipe`

## 6. JavaScript Memory Management & Performance
- **Memory Leaks & Garbage Collection**
  - Identifying memory leaks in Chrome DevTools
  - Event Listeners & Closures causing memory leaks
- **Optimizing Performance**
  - Debouncing vs. Throttling
  - Lazy Loading, Code Splitting, and Tree Shaking
  - WebAssembly (WASM) for high-performance computing

## 7. Metaprogramming in JavaScript
- **Proxies & Reflect API**
  - Creating dynamic objects
  - Intercepting property access
- **Symbols & WeakMaps**
  - Private properties using Symbols
  - WeakMaps for memory-efficient caching
- **Tagged Template Literals & Custom DSLs**
  - Building domain-specific languages (DSLs)
  - Writing custom templating engines

## 8. Mastering JavaScript Design Patterns
- Singleton, Factory, Observer, Decorator
- Module Pattern & Revealing Module Pattern
- Proxy Pattern (used in React, Vue, etc.)

## 9. Web APIs & Browser Internals
- IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver
- Service Workers & PWAs
- IndexedDB & WebSockets

## 10. Writing High-Quality JavaScript Code
- Clean Code Practices & SOLID Principles
- TypeScript for Type Safety
- ESLint & Prettier for Code Consistency

## 11. JavaScript Internals & Engine Optimizations
- **V8 Engine & Just-In-Time Compilation**
  - How JS engines optimize execution (hidden classes, inlining)
  - Deoptimizations (e.g., `try/catch`, accessing undefined properties)
- **Understanding JavaScript Bytecode**
  - Profiling and optimizing using Chrome DevTools

## Next Steps
To reach the top 1%, you must build projects, read JavaScript engine source code, and contribute to open-source libraries like React, Vue, or Node.js.
