# Execution Context Series

## Introduction
Understanding **Execution Context** is crucial for mastering JavaScript. This series will break down the concept from basic to advanced levels, ensuring a deep understanding of how JavaScript executes code behind the scenes.

## Folder Overview
The Folder is structured into the following parts:

### 1. EC Overview 
- This current file.

### 2. What is Execution Context?
- Definition of Execution Context
- Types of Execution Context:
  - Global Execution Context
  - Function Execution Context
  - Eval Execution Context

### 3. EC Lifecycle
- **Creation Phase / Memory Allocation**.
- **Execution Phase**.
- **Context Removal**.
- Code example with explaination.

### 4. Deeper dive
- **Creation Phase**
  - Memory Allocation
  - Scope Chain Creation
  - Variable Environment Setup
  - Function Declarations

- **Execution Phase**
  - Code Execution
  - Variable Assignment
  - Function Calls

- **Context Removal**
  - Garbage Collection
  - Returning Values

### 5. How Js runs code
- **JavaScript Execution Model**
  - Single-threaded nature
  - Event-driven architecture

- **Compilation vs. Interpretation**
  - Difference between compiled and interpreted languages
  - Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation in JavaScript
  - How JavaScript engines execute code

### 6. The Call Stack and Execution Context
- Understanding the **Call Stack**
- Execution Context lifecycle
- Stack overflow error (causes and prevention)
- Stack visualization with examples

### 7. Scope and Lexical Environment
- Definition of Scope in JavaScript
- Global vs. Local Scope
- Lexical Scope vs. Dynamic Scope
- Nested Execution Contexts
- Example breakdown

### 8. The Role of `this` in Execution Context
- How `this` is determined
- `this` in Global Execution Context
- `this` in Function Execution Context
- `this` in Arrow Functions
- `this` in Different Scenarios:
  - Object Methods
  - Event Listeners
  - `call`, `apply`, and `bind`

### 9. Asynchronous Execution Context (Event Loop)
- What happens when JavaScript runs async code
- The **Event Loop** and **Callback Queue**
- Web APIs, Promises, and Microtasks
- Example execution breakdown

### 10. Practical Use Cases and Optimization
- Debugging Execution Context Issues
- Common Mistakes and Best Practices
- Performance optimization


## Conclusion
By the end of this Folder, you will have a **deep understanding** of JavaScript's execution context, how the engine runs code.
