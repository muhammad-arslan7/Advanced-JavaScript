# What is Execution Context in JavaScript?  

## ðŸ“Œ Definition  
In JavaScript, an **Execution Context** is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. It manages variable declarations, function calls, and memory allocation while executing scripts. Understanding execution context is crucial for mastering JavaScript's **scope, closures, hoisting, and event loops**.  

Understanding Execution Context (EC) is essential as it determines how variables and functions are accessed and executed in your code.

### Explanation 
In simpler terms, whenever JavaScript code is executed, an Execution Context is created for that code. The Execution Context (EC) essentially consists of three components:

- **Global Context**: This is the default context where all JavaScript code runs initially. It holds global variables and functions that can be accessed from anywhere in the code. This part has to be executed at any case.

- **Function Context**: Each time a function is called, a new execution context is created for that function. This context contains variables and parameters specific to that function, allowing it to operate independently.

- **Eval Context**: This is a special context created when the `eval()` function is used to execute a string of JavaScript code. It has its own scope and can access variables from the surrounding context.

Understanding these components helps clarify how JavaScript manages code execution and variable accessibility. These Concepts will get revised with better understanding in next parts.
